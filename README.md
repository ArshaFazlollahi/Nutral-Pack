# Nutral-Pack
‚≠êAn all-purpose MC resource pack consisting of 100% gradients.

This resourcepack is currently a work in progress. So far I've been able to finish most of the items and you can feel free to preview them by downloading and unzipping the items folder. The pack will re-texture all of the textures whithin the game and add a gradient look to it. The pack is mainly aimed towards PVP players with the reduced sword and fire sizes however anyone can enjoy the 100% gradient look even in a simple survival world.

üìÉMy goal is also being able to re-program the models and blockstates to add custom 3D models and animations to the items and blocks.
